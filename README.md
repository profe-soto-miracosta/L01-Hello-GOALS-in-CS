# Lab 01 - Hello GOALS in CS!

## Learning Objectives
- Demonstrate editing, running, and testing of GitHub Classroom lab

## Instructions
1. **Investigate the code**
  
Open [Main.java](./Main.java) and look at the code. There is a lot of extra code for a
simple program, but today just notice that we have a `class` named `Main`, a method 
named `main` and a statement `System.out.println("Hello world.);`.

2. **Run the code**

Running or executing your code will allow you to see how it currently works,

There are a number of ways to run a program in VS Code, I suggest that you select the play button on the top right of the editor window.
   
The output will appear in the terminal window.

3. **Change the code**

**_To complete this lab_**, edit the code so it says:

```
Hello, GOALS in CS!
```

Note, it must say the above **exactly** as shown. 

4. **Test the code**

Built in tests can check your code to see if you have made the changes correctly. Run the test by clicking on the Erlenmeyer flask (cone flask) on the left-hand navigation menu, then clicking the play button, which becomes visible when you hover over one of the tests.
If your code passes the test, a green checkmark will appear. If you see a red X, click on the expected message and investigate the differences.

5. **Repeat steps 3 and 4 until done**

6. **Commit and Push your code**

   1. Click on the Source Control icon (three interconnected circles).
   2. Click on the plus sign next to the files you wish to commit.
   3. Enter a meaningful commit message.
   4. Click the Commit & Push button.
